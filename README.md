Hello, my name is Troy Wolf, and I am from Pepperell Massachusetts. I graduated from North Middlesex Regional High School, which has students from Pepperell, Townsend, and Ashby Massachusetts. The main activity I do outside of school is a variety of music ensembles. In High School this included, Jazz Band, Marching Band, Pit Orchestra, Wind Ensemble, my own Jazz Combo I ran called "The NM Jazz Ambassadors," and also competitve music competitions both at the district and state level. Through theses competitions I was able to be a part of one of the finest youth ensembles in the State of Massachusetts through my All-State audition. Here at RIT I'm thankfully able to continue this, through being a part of the Philharmonic Orchestra, the Jazz Ensemble, Trumpet Quintet, and hopefully much much more in the future. In High School, I also was a Boy Scout, and went on to recieve my Eagle Scout. Some of my other hobbies include Hiking, Fishing, Camping, and playing Video Games.

A few things I'd like to take away from this class are:
* Developing a better understanding of Software Engineering Process
* Become more comfortable with using process rather than simply code without a plan
* Learn about what lies ahead on the path of Software Engineering here at RIT
